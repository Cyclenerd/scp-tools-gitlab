      # As per documentation, the authentication to the GHCR registry must be done using a personal access token (PAT) to delete packages.
      # Only classic tokens can be used, fined-grained ones and GITHUB_TOKEN are currently (2024-01) not supported.

      #   https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token
      # The recommendation is to create a new PAT with only the `read:packages` and `delete:packages` scopes.
      # Create new token:
